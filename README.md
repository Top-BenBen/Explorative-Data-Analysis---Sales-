This project demonstrates the application of **Exploratory Data Analysis** techniques on a structured dataset using Python. The goal is to assess data quality, uncover patterns, and derive initial insights that can guide further modeling or decision-making.


##  Objective

To explore, clean, and analyze a dataset by:

* Understanding its structure
* Handling missing values
* Exploring variable distributions
* Identifying relationships between features
* Drawing insights from both visual and statistical observations


## Tools Used

* **pandas** â€“ for data loading and manipulation
* **numpy** â€“ for numerical operations
* **seaborn** & **matplotlib** â€“ for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook** â€“ for interactive coding


## Key Steps Performed

### 1. **Data Loading & Inspection**

* Imported the dataset and explored column names, data types, and shape.
* Reviewed sample records using `.head()` and summarized the data with `.info()` and `.describe()`.

### 2. **Data Cleaning**

* Identified and handled missing values.
* Converted columns to appropriate data types.
* Checked for and removed duplicates if any.

### 3. **Univariate Analysis**

* Examined individual variables using histograms and summary statistics.
* Analyzed distributions for skewness, outliers, and irregularities.

### 4. **Bivariate Analysis**

* Used scatter plots, box plots, and correlation matrices to investigate relationships between numerical features.
* Grouped categorical variables to compare trends across segments.

### 5. **Visualization & Interpretation**

* Highlighted meaningful patterns and distributions using graphs.
* Presented correlations and comparative trends using heatmaps and grouped charts.


## Outcome

The EDA revealed:

* Data quality issues requiring preprocessing
* Key variables that influence others
* Foundational insights for further predictive modelling or hypothesis testing

## Next Steps

* Perform feature engineering to prepare for machine learning
* Run statistical tests or build predictive models
* Visualize findings in a dashboard for stakeholders
